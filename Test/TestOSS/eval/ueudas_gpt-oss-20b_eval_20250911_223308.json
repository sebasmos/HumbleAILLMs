Syrup concentration 32 mg/mL. So volume: 150 mg / 32 mg per mL = 4.6875 mL. 225 mg / 33? Wait 32 mg? Actually 160 mg/5 mL => 32 mg/1 mL. So 225 mg/32 mg/m = 7.03125 mL. Usually we round to nearest 0.5 mL or 1 mL? Many pediatric syrups have 1 mLs increments. So recommended dose: about 5-7 mL. Typically 5 mL gives 160 mg, which is within 10-11 mg/kg? 160 mg / 15 kg = 10.67 mg/kg. That's fine. So answer: 5 mLs per dose.

That would give U=0.20. But we need to compute. But we also need Confidence: maybe 50%. Complexity: maybe 0.5. M from evidence: maybe 1? Actually M from evidence? They say M from evidence strengths. We can set M=0.8. Then compute H* =min(1,U + C*(...?). Wait formula: H* = max(1, ???). Provided earlier: H* computed as min(1,U + C*(???)?

Then U =  0.30*Data +0.30 *Model +0.20*OOD +0.2 *Structural.\n\n- Confidence: some percent.\n\n- Complexity: maybe 0.7?\n\n- M from evidence strengths: maybe 1? But M is evidence strength. Should be between 0-1. Let's set M=0.6.\n\n- Compute H* = minimum(1,  U + C * (1-M)). Q* =  U * (1+C) * (1 - M^2).\n\nLet's pick Data=0.8, Model=0.7, OOD=0.4, Structural=0.5. Then U=0.3*.8+0.3 *.7+0.2*.4+0.1? Wait structural weight 0.20. So 0.24+0.21+0.08+0.10=0.63. Good.\n\nSet Complexity C=0.75.\n\nM=0.55.\n\nCompute H* = U + C *(1-M) = 0 .63 + 0 .75*(1-0.55)=0.63+0.75*0.45=0.630+0.3375=0.9675. Min(1, ...) => 0.967. So H*=0.97.\n\nQ*",
