The case says guidelines have not recommended tDCS due to limited evidence, but some promise in small studies. So we need to provide probabilistic differential? Actually it's a diagnostic scenario? But the case is about treatment recommendation. However the template expects P - Probabilitic differential etc. We'll adapt accordingly: maybe differential diagnoses for pain? But we can treat as differential for appropriate therapy? Might be about whether to use tDCS. But we can still produce differential: e.g., tDCS vs pharmacologic therapy vs CBT vs exercise. Provide probabilities.\n\nWe need to compute Data, Model, OOD, Structural values between 0 and 1. These represent uncertainty contributions.

So we should advise not to start now because risk of intussuception. But maybe some guidelines allow starting at 16 weeks? Actually WHO says first dose no later than 15.5 weeks.

For RotaTeQ, three doses at 2, 4, 6 months. But still first dose before 15.4 weeks. So at 4 months (approx 18 weeks) it's too late. Should consider catch-up?

Let's set 0.65.\n\nOOD: Out-of-distribution relative to training data. This scenario is typical. So low OOD: maybe 0.\n\nStructural: 0 maybe 0?
